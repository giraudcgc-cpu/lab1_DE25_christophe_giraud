notes lab1:

---
code which did work	x

with open("dna_raw.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)

----
plan:
type of the text file, strings are list of characters, so i can iterate through the letters
extract seq 1  
Dictionary = can contain list, in order to loop, video 4:00, also use of .item to get dict with list of tuples? idea of dict = ([()]). ??
graph

---

key/value
seq/letters

Approach to create graphes:
Import matplotlib. pyplot module for visualization.
Open file in read mode 'r' with open( ) function.
Iterate through each line in the file using a for loop.
Append each row in the file into list as required for our visualization.
Using plt.

variables for the graph from the code, dicos:
count_letters_s1
count_letters_s2
count_letters_s3
count_letters_s4
