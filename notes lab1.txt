notes lab1:

placing the txt.file in my local cpu:
took the txt file and saved it in the local repo(repo's project)
Then, from VSC, I could run the code and the text file appeared in VSC on the left side with a U. 

---
code which did work	x

with open("dna_raw.txt", "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
    print(data)

----
plan:
type of the text file, strings are list of characters, so i can iterate through the letters
extract seq 1  
Dictionary = can contain list, in order to loop, video 4:00, also use of .item to get dict with list of tuples? idea of dict = ([()]).
graph

----
enumerate to use the line numbers? 
splitting letters and numbers with loop
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-splitting-text-and-number-in-string/


for i, line in enumerate(lines, 0):
    print(f"{i}.{lines}")


dict comprehension vid 7:55**
blabla = {}
my_dict = {what we want to do with the data for key,value in blabla.items()}
---
from dict to list 
key/value
letters/numbers

Approach to create graphes:
Import matplotlib. pyplot module for visualization.
Open file in read mode 'r' with open( ) function.
Iterate through each line in the file using a for loop.
Append each row in the file into list as required for our visualization.
Using plt.
